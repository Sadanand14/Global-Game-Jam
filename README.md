# Global-Game-Jam
This game project was created with a team of 2 others for submission at global game jam in January,2019.
The project is still a work in progress.
I was responsible for configuring enemy AI and different tree behaviors.
You basically play as a squirrel trying to steal nuts from other squirrel homes on trees nearby while preventing any enemy squirrels from stealing yours.
The goal is to collect a certain amount of nuts before a certain time limit.
